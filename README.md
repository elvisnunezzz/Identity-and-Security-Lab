<h1>Identity and Security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was divided on three mini-lab (part A, B and C) inside a lab. Itâ€™s like some if
statement inside a for loop. On each section I was implementing different network commands
that are used on Linux. Also, give the user access to different security fields related to the
internet and different configurations on the internet network with the ifconfig commands I was
able to see which is my IP Address, with the ping command I was able to verify that a
computer can communicate over the network with another computer or network device and also
to be able to track different locations with the traceroute command typing the IP Address of
the server that we want to look for the information or the location. In the same way we could see
the destinations and the receivers. The main point of this lab was to get the knowledge for future
lab and develop the skills in the networking field.
